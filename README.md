# HR InternetZuil

Chrome app that is a slimmed down browser for use as a kiosk.
The main intentional use was at the Rotterdam University as an 'InternetZuil'.

It launches a fullscreen browser to a hardcoded url with minimal navigation possibilities.

TODO:

- clear cache/history/cookies etc after idle
- allow popups to behave correctly
- make it student proof, disallow all local access
